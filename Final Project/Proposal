Inspired by the labor I am putting into the redesign and construction of my backyard,  
I intend to create a arduino controlled irrigation system.
 
Uninterested in embedding irrigation into the ground, and unwilling to spend every morning watering the plants, I am seeking to develop an arduino-controlled third way of keeping my yard healthy.
 
This device will consist of a 5+ gallon cistern with a digitally controlled valve, water flow meter and solar power cell.
 
Using the power from the solar array, the arduino will control the valve to open and release water.
Using the flow meter, once a certain volume of water is released, the valve will shut and await the next daysâ€™ watering.
