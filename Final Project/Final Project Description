Cistern-fed watering system.
Water is brought from a 5-gallon cistern into a solenoid valve, which uses the pressure of the water to activate.
In addition to the water pressure required for activation, the solenoid uses a 12 volt power supply to activate the valve.
The solenoid is triggered by a real time clock which is connected to the Arduino and is run using correct code and two Libraries which are downloaded into the Arduion #RTC and #Wire.
When a fixed variable, representing the time to open the valve == the current time, the solenoid valve is activated and water begins to flow through the system.
Upon water flowing through the system, it passes through a flow meter which is able to measure the amount of water flowing through the system and given the proper formula, measure the total amount of water that has flowed through.
Another fixed variable is set and when that variable == the amount of water that has flowed through the system, the valve is shut, the measuered variable within the flow meter loop is re-set to 0.
Once the valve is shut, the system waits until, once again, the Time fixed variable == the current time and the system loops once again
