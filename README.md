# Mechatronics-Summer2017
Initally, I had built my breadbord incorrectly.  I had created a hard connection between the light sensor and the LED, when what I needed to do was to create two independent circuits which are controlled through the software via the Arduino board.
Initial Range on Light Sensor is between 401-930
I slowed down the Delay to 75 to track the range of readings from the Serial Monitor
This all was challanging.  The assignment was just as much about exploring the ways to solving the problem as it was solving the actual problem.
- At this point, I am parroting code, and working with Micheal, it's more appearant how to unpack where to find and utilize the correct code.
- The Else / If conditions are making more sense as they set the parameters for action by arduino.
5/31 - The importance of proper taxonomy is becoming more clear - sensorPin v/ analogPin
6/1 - I ran into major problems when saving files - misnaming them means that they won't run
